## Inspiration

This was largely inspired by [Discount Bandit](https://github.com/Cybrarist/Discount-Bandit) 
which is a very similar application, but it lacks the flexibility to use any store without
code changes.

## Installation

### Docker

Easiest installation method is via docker-compose. Simply make a copy of 
[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) then tweak it to your liking then run
`touch .env && docker compose up -d`. If using the defaults, the app will be available at
`http://localhost:8080` with the username `admin@example.com` and password `admin`.

### Other methods 

Due to the complexity of the app and its dependencies, other installation methods 
are not recommended but if you are that keen to not use docker, look through the 
`docker/php.dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to see what is needed.

## Affiliate codes

By default, affiliate codes are added to a [couple of stores](config/affiliates.php), 
this supports development of the project. If you would rather not have affiliate codes 
added, you can set `AFFILIATE_ENABLED=false` in your docker compose file or `.env` file. 
If you do disable this, Maybe consider supporting the project in 
[other ways](https://pricebuddy.jez.me//support-project.html).

## Cron / Background tasks

The docker container has a cron job baked in that will take care of background tasks
such as fetching prices and sending notifications.

## Settings and configuration

Most common settings are exposed in the application settings page. For more advanced
settings you can edit the `.env` file in the root of the project.

## Development

This application is built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/). 
The development environment uses [Lando](https://lando.dev) to make it easier to 
setup the development environment.

Simply install lando, clone this repo, `cd pricebuddy` and run `lando start` to start 
the development environment.

### Code standards and testing

* Coding standards are enforced via [Laravel Pint](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/pint)
* Static code analysis via [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)
* Test coverage via [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/)
